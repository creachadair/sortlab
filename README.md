# SortLab

I wrote the Sorting Laboratory while teaching introductory Computer Science
courses, to help students visualize the behaviour of various sorting
algorithms.  It simulates the behaviour of selected algorithms, keeping track
of how many times the algorithm compares two values (comparisons) and how many
times the algorithm moves a data value (moves).

The code is written in somewhat obsolete Java, and is intended to run via the
now-moribund Java applet viewer. I have had some success building and running
it with OpenJDK 8, but there are probably various lingering deficiencies.
